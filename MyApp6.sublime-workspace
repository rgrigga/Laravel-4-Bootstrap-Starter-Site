Laravel is more than a theme generator.\n\nIf I may extract a few phrases from the original query:\n\nYou asked: \n\n<blockquote>\"I want to know if I can make wordpress plugins and themes using Laravel, or whether I should be doing things another way.\"</blockquote>\n\nI thought you said:\n\n\n<blockquote>\"should i be going things the other way around\"</blockquote>\n\nrephrase: \n  -can i make wordpress plugins in laravel\n  -can i make laravel plugins in wordpress\n  -can i make wordpress themes in laravel\n  -can i make laravel themes in wordpress\n\nLet's now discuss plugins vs. themes:\n\nThemes, in my opinion, are VIEWISH.  I use themes to create front-end styles, and some core structure like navigation, pages vs. posts, etc.  It's all very BLOGGISH in wordpress if you ask me.   Wordpress also has nice admin interface, site stats, etc.\n\nlet's continue:\n\nWordpress vs. Laravel\n\nLaravel itself being modular, and itself being a \"laravel plugin\", we should compare each available Wordpress with each available Laravel plugin:\n\nNow that we've compared the individual plugins, let's consider the methods of adding them.  Site maintenance, extend-ability, etc.  \n  -What's it take to develop a plugin in wordpress?  \n  -What's it take to develop a plugin in Laravel?\n\nPS: I read a good article the other day about how it is a big deal how Laravel has managed to decouple so many things... How does decoupling apply to wordpress?\n\nWhat is the wordpress equivelent of laravel's features:\n  -PHP 5.37?\n  -Artisan CLI?\n  -Eloquent ORM?\nAre any of these tools important to you?\n\nrephrase:\nwordpress vs. symfony\nwordpress vs. Eloquent\nwordpress vs. composer\nwordpress vs. packagist\nwordpress vs. TDD\nwordpress vs. Jeffrey Way\n\n\n\n    <code><pre>return View::make('you'('Winner/Laravel')</pre> </code>\n\nWordpress MVC Laravel MVC\n\n<a href=\"http://laravel.com/\" title=\"Laravel Features\" target=\"_blank\">http://laravel.com/</a>\n\nWordpress is my preferred blog tool, except for the bugs... \n\n\n\nWhy re-write any code that you don't have to?  Use the program, or one of it's available plugins.  Make your own plugin.  Make your own theme.  Re-use it.\n\nWordpress Theme is comparable to Bootstrap, Symfony, Blade... Use Wordpress if all you need is quick & dirty pages, posts, stats, etc. and you are most comfortable with it.  But ask yourself this: what will it take to re-use your work?  How will you implement it?  Did you say copy and paste?\n\nLaravel is the better all around tool to build modular flexible web applications.  If you are used to wordpress, and you need a quick & dirty, rusty old tool to fulfill your website's needs, then use wordpress.\n\nSome keywords: \n\nIf you're most familiar with it, use wordpress.\nNot planning on maintaining it?  Wordpress.\nNot building any further functionality?\nNot interested in   Simple blog : use wordpress.\n\nLaravel is tightly wound with bootstrap.\n\nPlugins and themes...\n\nAre you after display?  Plugins are quite different from themes, or at least they should be.  To me, themes are style-related.  Plugins are \n\nI also feel a lack of control at a certain point.  Wordpress is a user interface for blogging, site statistics, and themes, but falls short in \"back-end\".\n\nLaravel requires php 5.3.  Wordpress requires php 4.0.\n\nRephrasing this point: the foundation of the Wordpress is php 4 point whatever\nthe foundation of Laravel is php 5.3.7.   \n\nIf you have to choose one for all around development purposes... like \"which one would I rather use?\"  there is no quesiton.  If you are familiar with the Wordpress tools, use them.  \n\ntags:\n\nHere are some links:\n\n<a href=\"http://forums.laravel.io/viewtopic.php?id=5359\" target=\"_blank\">http://forums.laravel.io/viewtopic.php?id=5359</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17062182/what-problems-could-i-meet-with-laravel-4-on-php-5-3-3/17078845?noredirect=1#comment24745816_17078845\" target=\"_blank\">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17062182/what-problems-could-i-meet-with-laravel-4-on-php-5-3-3/17078845?noredirect=1#comment24745816_17078845</a>\n\nConnecting the two is very interesting.  Why reinvent the wheels that wordpress has solved?  Same the other way around.  \n\nWordpress Plugins for Bootstrap?\n\nJyle, it's been 4 months: how did this work out for you?  Looking back, how would you answer your own question today?\n\nI will now attempt to build wordpress plugin for laravel.  If you look for it, you will find it.

The intent is to demonstrate what the tools are capable of.\n</blockquote>\n\nFlickr is a good example of how tags can be used, but is also a good example of how they could be used BETTER.  There are several navigation problems, and by abstacting those for the user, we can solve that problem for flickr.  Most of all, we will solve the problem for our users.  \n\nThere is a dark side to social media.\n\nHere is an example of something that rubs me the wrong way:\n\nI searched twitter for \"small business\" within \"people you follow\".  That yielded the following:\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"thumbnails\">\n  <li class=\"span4\">\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"thumbnail\">\n      <img src=\"http://gristech.com/img/screen/40tweet.png\" alt=\"Tweet\">\n      <p class:\"photocredit\">1st Link: Twitter</p>\n    </a>\n    <p>Clicking that tweet leads you to...</p>\n  </li>\n\n  <li class=\"span4\">\n    <a href=\"#\" class=\"thumbnail\">\n      <img src=\"http://gristech.com/img/screen/40tweet.png\" alt=\"Tweet\">\n      <p class:\"photocredit\">2nd Link: Twitter</p>\n      <p>Clicking that tweet leads you to...</p>\n    </a>\n  </li>\n\n</ul>\n\nI find this tweet first:</p>\n<div class=\"thumbnail span6 pull-right\">\n	\n\n</div>\n<p>\nWhich leads me to this link:\n<a href=\"http://holykaw.alltop.com/a-step-by-step-guide-to-starting-a-small-business-website?tu4=1\">holykaw</a>\nwhich leads to this:\n<a href=\"http://holykaw.alltop.com/a-step-by-step-guide-to-starting-a-small-business-website?tu4=1\">2nd reblog</a>\n<a href=\"\">3rd reblog</a>\n<a href=\"\">Original content?</a>\n\nOn the one hand, I dislike others representing it as relavent, semi-original content.  \n\nThe extra clicks and stream of info is alot of wasted time, space, energy, and it might be diluted or warped from it's original intent.  That is the problem with this approach from a tactical point of view.  Irrelevant content, thus irrelevant users and/or bad user experience.  Not to mention the convoluted maintenance of an over complicated system.  Trust is precious thing.  \n\nThe big city market, so if you fish all the little fish.  As a user, I   I am curious: what percentage of these \n\nYou can also \"buy twitter followers\".  This is ultimately a really bad idea for a number of reasons.  The bottom line is: by trying to cut corners like this, you are ultimately hurting your business.\n\nNotice whatshisface has 1.3M twitter followers.  The thing I ask myself is: how many of their followers are real people, versus how many are robots, or programs, automated tweet things, or whatever?  75% of stats are made up, so we'll just say that the number is 75%.  Whatever.\n\nAlso keep this thing in mind when a company advertised \"20,000 twitter followers guaranteed\" or some such nonsense.  Who cares about 20,000 twitter followers generated by a robot?  If they are legitimately interested in your product, <em>you can find them without buying lists of robot crap</em>.  Buying leads is one thing: buying \"followers\" or \"facebook friends\" - give me a break.  Do you want to have to pay someone to be their friend?  Or pay someone else for their friends?  They're not even people.  It's a made up number.\n\nOr is it?  Could there be some value here?\n\nThere may be value in the structural (in MVC, this is a model).  The \n\nI have established a many to many relationship between tags and all my other models.  Basically, everything revolves around them, be it in their noun or their verb form.  \n\nI can say: flickr get photo\n\nor photo flickr stream\n\nand an app will come up to do that.  mow grass columbus\nhealth insurance columbus\n\n\n\n<img src=\"facebook-meta-description\" alt=\"\">\n\n<a href=\"http://holykaw.alltop.com/a-step-by-step-guide-to-starting-a-small-business-website?tu4=1\">Leecher</a>\n\nSome people I have discussed this idea with include:\n<ul>\n	<li></li>\n	<li>Developers with 20+ yrs experience</li>\n	<li>Aspiring developers with no experience</li>\n	<li>Attorneys with various expertise</li>\n	<li>Finance & Insurance executives</li>\n	<li>Real Estate & Mortgage Professionals</li>\n	<li>College professors</li>\n	<li>Business Owners in the following Industries:</li>\n	<li>\n		<ul>\n			<li>Foo</li>\n			<li>bar</li>\n		</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\nRegardless of which of these group you belong to, you should be able to find good information here.

In fact, it's interesting to learn that Facebook WANTS you to use them.  Their greatest commodity: the ONLY commodity, you might say, is <em>traffic</em>.  They provide and maintain an API (Application Programming Interface) which allows developers to access their services and their data.  At this time, they provide it for FREE.  Why?

I don't think it's debateable that consumer spending and consumer activity is growing rediculously fast.  Do you think Craigslist and Ebay killed classified advertising?  Me Too.</p>\n	<p>Anyway, the new Web Services also collect information about you and your interest, like the man doing a survey at a Home & Garden show.  I have been that man: and the goal is to collect sales leads.  Targeted leads with demographic \"meta-information\" about you.  The better qualified and interested you are, the better my time is spent on you.  If you can't buy, I'm not calling you.  If don't need my product, I'm not calling you.  If you're \"not interested\", I'm not calling you.\n	If you...</p>\n	<p>	Hold on there.  I just said three things I'd like to recap:</p>\n	<ol>\n		<li>You are not qualified</li>\n		<li>You are not interested</li>\n		<li>You </li>\n	</ol>\n	<p>I want you to think about your industry for a moment.  Do you know salespeople in your industry who waste time trying to sell things to </p>\n	<p>You're aware credit bureaus market your information like this, too, right?  Are they transparent?  Do you know what data they collect, how it's stored, shared, and with whom, and do you have access to the same data?  How is your score calculated?  <em>No One Really Knows</em>.</p>\n\n	<p><em>Technology solves all of these problems, and more.</em></p>\n	<p>Business that use the Web App gain all the advantages of it's features.  The benefits include increased efficiency in both sales and internal processing/staff interaction....</p>\n	<p>Now, a developer-friend of mine recently said to me: \"Web Apps Suck.\"  I have a question for you: Do you ever use google?  Is that not a web app?  Do you think they have figured out how to make it work good?  How about our other friends: </p>\n	<p>Are those websites, web services, web apps, or what?  Yes all the way around, right?</p>\n	<p>So here's the thing: you have ALL of the world's services available to you for free.  What it costs you is your personal information.</p>\n	<p>Some people are VERY paranoid about sharing their personal information, and therefore about using technology in general.  And for good reason: for example: Twitter was recently hacked.//ref </p>\n\n	<p>I have many articles mostly written, and thousands of links to great, current, relavent content: relavent to industries://list</p>\n	<p>Much of my content is currently scattered and disorganized.  I sometimes have a messy desk.  Not <a href=\"http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-03-17/local/37795617_1_messy-desk-girl-scout-cookies-city-paper\">Messy Desk</a>.  Not that bad, but pretty messy.</p>\n	<p>I'll tell you, what, though- I get the job done though.  Ask anyone I've ever worked for or with if </p>\n	<p>Also: I am intentionally <a href=\"http://www.mindtools.com/brainstm.html\">brainstorming</a>.  </p>\n	<p>I can personally teach Advanced HTML, Advanced CSS, Beginners Javascript, *Advanced PHP,...</p>\n	<p class=\"muted\">* I use the word 'Advanced' relative to the average non-developer.  I understand advanced PHP, Laravel, Javascript, etc., but I cannot hold a candle to the guys that invented it, wrote it, maintained it, built it, etc.  Amongst the pool of developers whom I respect the most, I am easily humbled, and sometimes a bit shy.  Relative to anyone with 5 or less years experience in this industry, I think I am qualified to hold a solid conversation and demonstrate leadership.  I have great respect for the leaders of this community.  How do I feel about the leaders of my local community?  Have I become so disgusted with Government that I am not aware of their actions?  Which is better: my government or my community?</p>\n\n 			</div>\n 		</div>\n 	</div>\n\n 	 <div class=\"accordion-group\">\n 		<div class=\"accordion-heading\">\n 			<a class=\"accordion-toggle\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-parent=\"#accordion2\" href=\"#collapseFour\">\n 				<h2>What it does</h2>\n 			</a>\n 		</div>\n 		<div id=\"collapseFour\" class=\"accordion-body collapse\">\n 			<div class=\"accordion-inner\">\n	<p>For the business owner, it automates things, and gives the owner the ability to work faster, make less mistakes, and ultimately not let things slip through the cracks.</p>\n	<p><a href=\"messy desk photostream\">Accounting?</a></p>\n 			</div>\n\n		<div>\n			<p>One thing a web app helps ME with is to organize my ideas.  By tagging, organizing, saving, and looking up my data for me, I can spend my time doing more creative and productive things.  This applies on EVERY level.   *//bank disclaimer I'm here to tell you that it applies to the banks.  (If you don't know me, I was in mortgage banking between 2001-2013 with about a 2 year break near the end.  I have thorough and extensive mortgage knowledge, and intimate understanding of how bank systems, credit bureau systems, as well as the consumer experience, customer service policies and procedures.)</p>\n\n			I am comfortable in telling you that we did not have a single, central list or resource for the correct departments to transfer phone calls to.  We have a searchable intranet that .  This is big data at it's finest.  But the challenge is not big data: the solution is simple, object-oriented, modular models, and better designed systems.  I could DEFINITELY contribute to the high-level design of bank software.  Not the \"How\" but the \"What\" - and the \"how does this benefit the company and the customer and the community?\"  The \"how do we apply this technology to this problem to make it a better customer experience\"?  I beleive this philosphy \n			I can see how to optimize the customer experience: and increase <em>true</em> customer satisfaction.\n			But you know what?  I don't want to work for the bank right now.  I don't beleive in it.  I beleive the bank is necessary, but I don't feel confident in my own ability to navigate the red tape and corporate polits necessary to make a difference.  Half of my time was done doing the job of a different department.  It's a fascinatingly complex \n			  That environment is opposite from this in many ways.  It is HIGHLY regualted.  HIGHLY organized in small details, to a. comply with regulations, b. save profits via security, transaction detail, etc.  The ultimate security systems are required because it is high-stakes, highly personal information.  It is also much to the bank's favor.\n			Here's the thing... I did not mention above that the software helps to create a better experience for the customer.  Nor did I mention that it improves employee efficiency.  Never before has software been so heavily capable of being user friendly.\n\n			Let me say that again: Never before has software been so heavily capable of being user friendly.  What I mean by that is that the technology we have today is truly amazing if you think about it in the scope of the last 10-50 years.  \"They\" said .\n\n			What did \"they\" tell you about the stock market?  This is a fascinating thing: where on the priority scale does Improving Customer Service fall?\n\n			Do you know why the internet is not regulated?  2 things come to mind: \n			<ol>\n				<li>They can't.  It's just too big.</li>\n				<li>it's public.  it self-regulates.</li>\n				<li>BTW: could it be taxed?</li>\n			</ol>\n\n			I will not put in writing, but do have experience to dwell upon and knowledge of the interior processes of the banks.  Some of the processes I could describe are public to any 'intutive consumer'.  Others could violate a non-disclosure agreement I have with the bank, but I could discuss some things in an appropriate environment.\n\n			by the way, here is a \n		</div>\n\n		<div class=\"idea pull-right well\">\n			<h3>More Ideas</h3>\n			<ul>\n				<li>\n					\n				</li>\n				<li>\n					<p>\n						Common data formats are shared by Google, Yahoo, Bing, Flickr, YouTube, Twitter, Facebook.
