The more I think about this, the more I think, "what if I had just given him the $100?  Since i wasn't willing to do that, he was noticably less helpful."

The conversation went something like this:

Me: I want the data back

Who owns the data stored on your cell phone?

***
I have been a verizon customer for well over 10 years, and probably spent in excess of $30,000 over the years.  Maybe more.  My wife dropped her phone in a puddle last week, and the pictures were not backed up. Shame on us.

Luckily, we had the insurance.  Unluckily, after spending an hour and a half filing a claim together in the store, the Verizon employee, Bryan Barber, told her she had to surrender the dead phone to file the claim.  

Other than, "it's the policy", I'd like to hear one good reason why "Verizon", "TechProtect", or whatever other entity needs this bricked phone.

Here's the bottom line: the data still exists in the internal memory, and I want an opportunity to retreive it.

***
To be fair, there is a bit more to this story.  My wife went to the store, explained the situation, and Bryan seemed helpful at first.  In hindsight, though, I beleive the hour-long process she had to go through to file this claim is by design.

During that initial conversation, he did offer her the chance to take the old phone, hack on it for however many days or weeks, and bring it back another time.  But we're all busy, aren't we?  She spends half her day on the phone, not to mention being dependant on it for email, to-do list, calendar, and all the other apps that make smartphones so great.

So, she didn't want to go days or longer with no phone... He said something to the effect of, "Well, I'm not supposed to do this, but I could let you take it for a few days as long as you promise to bring it back by 6:00 on Sunday".  Seems fair enough, so she took that option.

If the story stopped at this point, I would praise Bryan for trying to do the right thing for his customer rather than adhere to the average red-tape.

However, that is not the end of this story.  He still submitted the initial paperwork for the claim, triggering the insurance company to expect him to turn the dead phone in, "or else".  

I tried for several hours at a time for several days to fix the phone.  Searching the internet leads to a myriad of blog posts, youtube videos, and forums.  There's a lot of junk advice out there, but I found a few good tidbits out there.  After taking the battery out and leaving the phone in a bag of rice for 2 days, I put the battery in and turned it on: IT WORKED!  The home screen came up, and I started the process of turning on USB access (this is an Android - Motorola Droid 3 to be exact.)

After a few minutes of trying this, I was notified the battery was about to die.  I then tried to charge it.  At first, the phone would begin to boot up, but eventually the screen would just go blank.  Now, I can plug it in *without a battery* and the little white light on the side will come on.  The screen looks like it glows, but the home screen no longer comes up.

Well, now it's been 6 days, and I have to take the phone back as agreed.  I am not satisfied with this, though: I want to disassemble the phone, clean with alcohol, try a new battery, and maybe try other data recovery software I read about.  I even read about a method to solder a plug directly to the chip.  I am geek enough to attept this stuff: it's all a long shot, but I am willing to spend my "spare time" on it since the missing family pictures are important to US.

I took the phone to the store, hoping to talk to a technician about it.  Instead, Bryan physically took the phone from me and told me, "I will personally have to pay $500 if the phone is not sent back at this point.  I don't have $500 so that's not going to happen."

I have offered to return the other "new" phone, pay for it out of pocket, reactivate a different, used phone, or simply go without a phone on that line... any of those solutions are possible and reasonable.  At one point, Brian was going ot try to "unwind" the insurance claim.  But after a few phone calls, the answer to that was, "it's not possible".

Bryan said: "It's gone, and there's no way you are ever getting it back".  The phone is literally in the back room at the verizon store right now, I am willing to find some other solution, but they 

I never raised my voice, but I did proceed to call customer service and the warranty company while standing in the showroom, and I proceeded to say things like, "I can't beleive verizon would treat a customer like this.  We have been a cusotmer for about 12 years, and we've always had great service."

I was asked to leave, I refused, the police were called, and I eventually left.

The police said, "the phone is Verizon's property".  I argue that the data is OUR property.  a year worth of my wife's family pictures is all I care about.  We never would have began this claim if we had know that the old device had to be surrendered.

At one point today, I was told, "If you had just told us it was lost instead of wet, you still would have been covered, and we never would have known otherwise".  If that's the case, why do you need the brick back at all?  At one point I was told, "I have an old 3g blah blah in my car I can sell you for $100".  So, the only proposed "shoulda coulda" solutions are: Lie, or a "Curb Purchase".  Is that what's going to actually happen to my other phone?  Sell it to someone else for $100?

There's more to this story than can be discussed in this text-box.  I have escallated this issue to TechProtect's National Sales Manager, Eric Martin.  I am also prepared to file complaints with Verizon Corporate, the BBB, and whatever other relavent organizations I can find.

The old adage goes that a happy customer may tell 3 people about a good experience, and the unhappy customer tells 10, or 30, or 300... I am excited to share this experience one way or the other with anyone who will listen... I would rather tell everyone that Verizon stepped up to make this right, which is why i am a huge verizon cheerleader.  It's really up to you how you choose to treat your customer.

Again, give me ONE good reason other than, "it's the corporate policy" why that phone needs to be in New Jersey rather than on my desk.  I've proposed solutions: are you willing to help? 

That's how today ended, but it bagan with Bryan Barber phycially taking the old phone form me and refusing to give it back.  He's afraid that he did something wrong by allowing us to attempt to recover the data.  His job is to file the claim and send the phone back.  This policy does not accomodate your customer's needs.  

Therefore, I am writing you this message in hopes of a return call.  I am begging you: please do not ship my family pictures off to some black hole.


ALl you have to do is reverse the claim and give me the phone with the pictures.  Brian physically took it from me today and refused to give it back, refused to offer any other resolution other than selling me a phone he had in his car.  Is that what you're doing with my old phone?

  I offered to pay for the new phone, 

Brian Barber seemed very helpful at first: he "allowed" my wife to have the phone for 6 days, with the agreement that we would bring it back at the end of the week.  Since then, I have been through dozens of forums, webpages, youtube crap... there is alot of (mostly useless) information out there, but I do have a few glimmers of hope.  I have successfully recovered data from failed hard drives in desktops and laptops, etc. in the past, and I am not ready to give up on this.

Unfortunately, the first 6 days was not long enough.  I want to try a new battery.  I want to try disassembling the phone, cleaning with alcohol, and reassembling it.  I read about a method to solder connections directly to the chip to access the data.  This is pushing the limits of my abilities, but I have several friends I would like to run it past, and over the next few weeks, maybe I'll be able to recover the data.  I went into the store today in hopes of talking to a technician, but I understand that verizon no longer employs technicians.  If you're reading this, maybe you know somebody?  Regardless, this is not something that can be done in 5 minutes in the store.

Meanwhile, an insurance claim has been processed.  Brian is under pressure to deliver the "surrendered" phone to the insurance company according to their cliams process.  That policy is understadable on the surface but 

The bottom line is that the phone is a brick, and will do nobody else any good.  My dealings with Brian Barber did not go well today: the police were eventually called, and I was asked to leave.  The phone is physically in the store at this moment, but you're about to send it to New Jersey.  Please don't.  I have escallated this issue to Tech Protect's national sales manager, Eric Martin, and I am expecting a call from him tomorrow.  I also expect a call from "Andrew", the westerville store manager.
