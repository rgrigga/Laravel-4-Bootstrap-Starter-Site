<div class="myreply">
<pre>I found your job listing on Craigslist, and I am interested in this job, so please enjoy my attached resume.

(If you have any difficulty with the attachment, you can also view it online here): https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JK9YqubdSTVvjvHetuf-0dWrNbodv276Z51SUJkZpGw/edit?usp=sharing

Fair warning: I am a little new to this business, and frankly, I hate job hunting.  Thus, I might appear a little nervous, or scattered, or unpolished.  That may all be true, but with a little guidance, I'll do my best to be a rock star for you... I'm very motivated, determined, and I'm a much better worker than I am a job hunter, so please bear with me... 

With that said, I hope you enjoy what I've put together, and I'm looking forward to hearing if you think a guy like me would be a good fit for your company.  If you would be so kind as to reply either way, I would appreciate it.  Thank you!

PS: I recently built something using Laravel, PHP, Ajax, LESS, and Wordpress: please have a look: http://gristech.com.  Again, it's not super-polished, but should demonstrate a few of my interests and potential.

Thank you for your consideration!</pre>

<pre>About Us
Small and powerful digital-only agency seeks web designer. Our guiding principle is that by helping our clients we help our business. 

About You
'Designer' is just what it says on your CV - because what you really do, what you live for, is solving problems. Your portfolio isn't a series of beautiful but generic templates - it's a collection of stories that you can discuss with enthusiasm, and regret ... because you're always getting better at what you do and you're never satisfied with 'good enough'. You're equally comfortable discussing color theory, user psychology, or font foundries, you're a writer of excellent HTML & CSS . You're excited about the endless potential of the web, and being able to build things that thousands of people can use every day. Oh, and one more thing, you have experience in WordPress.

Your skills
Your core responsibility will be in combining your knowledge and expertise with the goals of our business to deliver a world-class user experience. You will be a passionate advocate for the user, dedicated to the craft of design and excited about working in an agile, collaborative environment.

Simplicity: Good design is invisible.

Collaboration: You'll be working alongside developers to create elegant user experiences; you should thrive on feedback, critique and iteration.

Visual Design: Photoshop or whatever works for you. Your process is your own; you get to decide which tools you use.

HTML/CSS: You'll be given full ownership of your ideas, and so you'll be required to both create beautiful mockups/wireframes/prototypes - and implement them.

Location: Columbus, OH
Compensation: $65/hr to start
This is a contract job.
Principals only. Recruiters, please don't contact this job poster.
Please do not contact job poster about other services, products or commercial interests.</pre>
