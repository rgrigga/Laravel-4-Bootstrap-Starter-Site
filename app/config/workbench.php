// File Sharing
// :: Send or receive documents securely via any of the following methods:

// WebDav
// Dropbox
// Google
// Email

// Example: 

// You have a signed contract you want to share with a user.  Your company uses secure email, but the user does not.
// However, the user uses facebook.  You send them a facebook link to the document.

// In fact, you don't even have to specify that you want to send them a facebook link,
// although you can if you want.  All you have to do is set up a document, 
// and say "share document."
